          agree to the following terms and conditions, along with our return and
          warranty policies, privacy policy, and terms of use. Please review

        <h2>Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          You (“Customer”) may place orders for Products with CricketWeapon
          ("we," "our") via our website or, in certain circumstances, over the
          phone. By placing an order, you consent to these Terms and Conditions
          of Sale (“Terms”) and acknowledge that we will furnish the Products
          subject to these Terms. Any term or condition in any order or other
          form or correspondence that is inconsistent with these Terms shall be
          inapplicable and of no force and effect whatsoever, unless expressly
          agreed to in writing by CricketWeapon.
        </p>
        <h2>Orders</h2>
        <p>
          All orders are subject to CricketWeapon's acceptance. We may refuse to
          accept, cancel, or limit any order or order quantity for any reason,
          even after an order confirmation has been sent. If we cancel an order
          after you have been charged, we will refund you the charged amount.
        </p>
        <h2>Product Offering</h2>
        <p>
          All product descriptions on our website are subject to change without
          notice at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to change or
          discontinue a product at any time. While we make every effort to
          display the colors and images of the products accurately, we cannot
          guarantee that your device's display will be an exact reflection of
          the physical item.

          charges, which are calculated and displayed based on the selected
          shipping option during checkout. The prices on the website may differ
          from those in physical stores that stock CricketWeapon products. We
          reserve the right to correct pricing errors and notify you of any

          behalf, we may invoice Customer for those amounts.

        <h2>Payment</h2>

          Available shipping options will be displayed during the checkout
          process. Any shipping timeframes provided are estimates, and we cannot

          but if you no longer need an item due to a late delivery, please
          contact our Customer Service Department. Refer to our return policy
          for available options. All risk of loss or damage to the products
          passes to you upon taking physical possession, and title passes to you
          when the products are picked up by the shipping carrier.
        </p>
        <h2>Returns</h2>
        <p>
          Once an order has been placed and accepted, you may not cancel the

          charges) plus any applicable tax. Return shipping expenses are the
          customer's responsibility. Products must be returned within thirty

        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
          unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
