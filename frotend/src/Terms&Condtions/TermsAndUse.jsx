        <p>
        When you, the customer ("Customer"), place orders for products with Manefest ("we," "our") through our website, you are consenting to the following Terms and Conditions of Sale ("Terms"). By acknowledging these Terms, you understand that the products will be provided to you in accordance with these terms. It is important to note that unless expressly agreed upon or documented in writing by Manefest, any terms or conditions present in any order, form, or correspondence that conflict with these Terms will be deemed inapplicable and without any force or effect.

        <h2>Orders</h2>
        <p>
        All orders placed are subject to acceptance by Manefest. This implies that Manefest reserves the right, for any reason, to refuse, cancel, or limit any order or order quantity, whether or not the order has been confirmed. The receipt of an order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it confirm our offer to sell. It serves as a confirmation of receiving your order. In the event that we need to cancel an order after you have been charged, Manefest will promptly refund the charged amount.

Your understanding is appreciated, and we are dedicated to maintaining transparency and fairness in our order processes at Manefest.

        </p>
        <h2>Product Offering</h2>
        <p>
        Please note that all product descriptions on our website are subject to change at any time, without prior notice, and at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue a product at any time. While we have taken every effort to present colors and images of the products as accurately as possible, we cannot guarantee that your device's display of any color will precisely reflect the actual physical item upon receipt.

Your understanding of these conditions is appreciated, as we aim to ensure transparency and provide you with the best possible shopping experience at Manefest.

        </p>
        <h2>Price</h2>
        <p>
        Please be aware that all prices are subject to change until the time you place your order and it is accepted by Manefest. The prices displayed for products on this website do not include shipping charges, which will be calculated and presented based on the selected shipping option when you finalize your purchase. It's important to note that the prices on this website may vary from those in physical stores that carry Manefest products, as these stores operate independently of Manefest.

Manefest reserves the right to adjust pricing in the case of any errors displayed due to human error, computer malfunction, or any other reason. If a pricing error is identified after you have submitted an online order, Manefest will promptly notify you of the correction. You may then choose whether to proceed with the purchase of the product(s) at the corrected price.

Your understanding is valued, and we aim to provide a transparent and fair pricing experience at Manefest.

        <h2>Shipping</h2>
        <p>
        The available shipping options will be presented during the checkout process. Any timeframe provided by Manefest regarding when the product(s) may ship or be delivered is a good faith estimate. While we make every effort to meet this timeframe, it is not a guarantee. The actual delivery of your order can be influenced by various events, some of which are beyond our control. Manefest cannot be held liable for late deliveries.

If you find yourself in a situation where you no longer have use for an item due to a delayed delivery, please contact our Customer Service Department promptly. For available options, please refer to our return policy.

        The risk of loss or damage to the products shall be transferred to you, or a person designated by you, upon taking physical possession of the product(s). In the event that items are lost or damaged during transit, please reach out to our Customer Service Department for assistance.
