## Hosting Your Complete App on Vercel

This guide will walk you through the process of hosting your complete MERN stack app on Vercel using the `vercel.json` configuration.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

- Organize your project with a root directory that contains both frontend and backend folders.
- Ensure both backend and frontend directories have all necessary code and dependencies.
- Create a `vercel.json` file in the root directory.
- Add the following code to `vercel.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
      {
        "src": "./backend/server.js",
        "use": "@vercel/node"
      },
      {
        "src": "./frotend/build",
        "use": "@vercel/static"
      }
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "/(.*)",
        "destination": "/backend/server.js"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  - Note :
    - Using this configuration will require you to run npm run build in the frontend directory before deploying to Vercel.
    - Ensure your folder structure looks like this:
      ```json
        root
        ├── backend
        ├── frontend
        │   ├── node_modules
        │   ├── package.json
        │   ├── build
        │   └── ...
        ├── node_modules
        ├── package.json
        ├── vercel.json
        └── ...
      ```

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

- Push all your code to GitHub, ignoring the `node_modules` folder and `.env` file.

### Step 3: Create a Vercel Account

- Create an account on Vercel if you haven't already.
- Connect your GitHub account to Vercel.

### Step 4: Create a Vercel Project

- Create a new project in Vercel.
- Select your GitHub repository (e.g., CricketWeapon-store).

### Step 5: Configure Project Settings

- Configure the project settings:
  - Keep the settings as they are.
  - Add all your `.env` variables in the Environment Variables section.

### Step 6: Deploy Your App

- Click on "Deploy" and wait for a few minutes for the deployment process to complete.

### Step 7: Visit Your App

- Once the deployment is successful, click on "Visit" to access your live app.

### Step 8: Enjoy Your App

- Congratulations! Your app is now live and accessible.
